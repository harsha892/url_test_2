				<!-- ===== Payment and Refunds ==== -->
				<h2>Payment and Refunds</h2>
				<p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Site, including any
					Services, (each such purchase, a “Transaction”), please note that we use a third-party payment
					service (the “Payment Service”), to collect payments for such Transactions. If you wish to make a
					Transaction, you will be directed to a web page hosted by the Payment Service (or its service
					providers) and not by StoryTech (the “Payment Service Page”). You agree that StoryTech payment
					vendors may store your payment information. Your use of the Payment Service Page will be subject to
					the Payment Service’s user agreement and privacy policy, not this Agreement or our Privacy Policy.
					You acknowledge and agree that StoryTech is not, and will not be, responsible or liable for the
					Payment Service’s services, its site or any acts or omissions of the Payment Service.
				</p>
				<p>We offer optional premium paid services such as the DEET Resume Premium Plans. By purchasing a
					premium service, you agree to pay the fees associated with the product that you order. Payments will
					be charged when you register for the premium service and will include the premium service for the
					indicated period (as mentioned in the premium plan).
				</p>
				<p>StoryTech reserves the right to modify or change the amount paid for this service and the time period
					during which the subscription remains valid. StoryTech will do its best to guarantee full access to
					the site until the subscription remains valid but will not be liable for any disruption caused owing
					to unforeseen circumstances or upon termination of the site. No refunds will be allowed. Refunds, if
					allowed will only be limited to the current subscription amount for the current paid service of
					subscription and will be at the sole discretion of the owner of the site. You can cancel your
					subscription anytime by accessing the payment link on the site. After payment cancellation you will
					still have full access to the site until the subscription expires unless your account is terminated
					or StoryTech ceases to exist or is terminated. We reserve the right to delete also the Premium
					accounts if the user is misusing or doing malicious activities on the services, but we doubt this
					will be the case.
				</p>

					brought into the App is done so by your own volition and with your discretion. Each third party
					website linked from the App has its own terms and conditions which will apply to you and are
					separate from the Terms and Conditions specified herein. You expressly relieve DEET from any and
					all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, application, service or content.
					DEET will not share any of this information with any other 3rd party without express consent and
					request by you.</p>
